                <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
                <p>
                  For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
                  children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
                  up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.

                  springing up around the country.
